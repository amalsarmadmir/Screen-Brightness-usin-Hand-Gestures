# Screen Brightness Control Using Hand Gestures

This project enables users to control their computer's screen brightness through hand gestures using Python and a webcam. It utilizes **OpenCV** for gesture detection and **ScreenBright** for adjusting brightness.

## Project Overview

This Python project allows users to adjust their screen's brightness using hand gestures detected via a webcam. The system tracks hand movement, recognizes specific gestures, and accordingly increases or decreases the screen brightness. It offers a hands-free, user-friendly interface to control screen brightness, improving accessibility and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: To capture video input and process frames for gesture detection.
- **Mediapipe**: Used to detect and track hand landmarks.
- **ScreenBright**: Adjusts screen brightness based on detected gestures.
